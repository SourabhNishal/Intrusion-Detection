# Intrusion-Detection
This project builds an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for Software-Defined Networking (SDN) using machine learning. It detects network attacks using the NSL-KDD dataset. Two models, SVM and ANN, were trained and evaluated, achieving high accuracy in identifying various attack types.
